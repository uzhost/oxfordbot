To run the Telegram bot, you'll need to install a few Python packages:

python-telegram-bot: A Python wrapper for the Telegram Bot API. You can install it using pip:

[code]pip install python-telegram-bot[/code]
requests: A Python library for making HTTP requests. You can install it using pip:
Copy code
pip install requests
Once you've installed these packages, you can save the bot code in a file with a .py extension and run it using Python. Make sure to replace your_app_id_here, your_app_key_here, your_bot_token_here, and YOUR_CHAT_ID with your own values before running the code.
